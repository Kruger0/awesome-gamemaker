# This workflow is set to look at all the links in the README.md every six months. If there are any links that spit out a 404 or other error, it will get listed in the Links workflow summary, and the badge on the README will state whether it's "passing" or "failing".

# If it is failing, you will need to access the latest Links action that was ran, remove/replace any links that return an error, and then manually run the workflow again.
